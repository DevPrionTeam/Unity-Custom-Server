# -= Unity Custom Server =- 
This is a WYP custom server made for online games using Unity engine.
You can use pretty much to do any sorta of games, including MMORPGs and such.
Since this is a custom server, you can edit anything you want on the source and redo any packet you want,
to fit your needs !
And it's since its custom, it covers everything from zero to "functional state".

OBS : THIS IS NOT A READY TO USE FRAMEWORK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, LIKE OTHER POPULAR NAMES WHEN IT COMES TO UNITY NETWORKING,
THIS IS A FULL NETWORKING SERVER, COVERING FROM START TO FINISH, HOW A DEDICATED NETWORK SERVER WORKS WITH UNITY, WHICH WILL NEED 
A CLIENT CODE TO CONNECT WITH IT, WHICH WILL BE POSTED UP HERE SOON ENOUGH !

-= WHATS WORKING NOW =-
- Server can handle connections with clients.
- Server comes with one, already built-in, welcome packet as an exemple.
- You can connect with the server normally.


-= TODO LIST =-
- Server needs a UDP protocol on it [WIP].
- Server can keep using cpu while on idle, due the lack of an propper thread handler.
- Server can still lose some packets on the way to the client, at this point of the project.


This server is still under initial development

Credits for the main idea for this project, goes to Tom Weilan !
